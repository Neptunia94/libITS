Looking for many traces, frogs example, with CGAL input
../bin/its-reach -i test_models/cgal/frogs.gal -t CGAL -reachable 'Check.state==1' -manywitness 5  --quiet

its-reach command run as :

../bin/its-reach  -i  test_models/cgal/frogs.gal  -t  CGAL  -reachable  Check.state==1  -manywitness  5  --quiet
