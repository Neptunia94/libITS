This document presents Instantiable Transition Systems, both from a
formal standpoint and from the more pragmatic view of the ITS
library.

Instantiable Transition Systems (ITS) are a semantic framework to
express model semantics in a compositional way, that allows to
enable efficient Set Decision Diagram (SDD) solution engines.

ITS are general enough to capture most transition systems such as
automata, Petri nets, or any discrete state transition system.

ITS introduce a notion of \emph{type} and \emph{instance} to allow a
compositional model definition. Composition is supported through the
notion of \emph{transition synchronization}, with a flexible
Composite definition that allows to compose ITS instances.
